My name is **Irma** (pronounced `/ˈiː.mə/` or _eema_).  
I was born in **Phnom Penh, Cambodia** in the year 2000, and I’ve been based in **France** since 2013.

I like to **create things and see them come to life**. Learning new technology to make things even **prettier and flashier** is what drives me as a **front-end developer**. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me traveling to experience the different **colors and scents** of the world — or creating something just for the joy of it.

### 🎯 Goals for the Future

I doing what **I love**, proud of what **I create**, and surrounded by **amazing people**.  
Someday, I’d love to win an award for **Best Website** — it's a long shot, but hey, dreams fuel the grind 💫

Take a leap and **bet on me**. Let me be part of the future, **your** future.  
I’m part of the **newer generation**, driven by our **hunger** to learn.  
The past generations **walked** so we can **run**.  

I am extremely **flexible**, coming from my background, being culturally Cambodian and French, I have a big capacity to **adapt**.  
I’m also ready to make any **sacrifices** to push through any **obstacles**, to **evolve** and create a better future with you.  

Who knows, I might be your **new favourite colleague**!

### 🎮 How It All Started

My journey began with a love for **art**, **creativity**, and **understanding systems**.
It all started by editing **Tumblr** and **DeviantArt** themes with HTML & CSS—bringing my visions to life online.

Then I discovered video games, which sparked a deep interest in **game development**.
Over time, that passion shifted toward creating applications—whether web or mobile—that make an impact on users, whether big or small.
That’s what led me to front-end development.

I wasn’t the best at drawing, but I realized I could still create the **worlds and visions in my head** through code — and that felt amazing.

From the **art community** to the **dev community**...
