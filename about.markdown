# Hello World! 🌍

My name is **Irma** (pronounced `/ˈiː.mə/` or _eema_).  
I was born in **Phnom Penh, Cambodia** in the year 2000, and I’ve been based in **France** since 2013.

I like to **create things and see them come to life**. Learning new technology to make things even **prettier and flashier** is what drives me as a **front-end developer**. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me traveling to experience the different **colors and scents** of the world — or creating something just for the joy of it.

## 🎮 How It All Started

My journey began with a love for **gaming**, **understanding systems**, and **being creative**.  
That’s what led me to front-end development.

I wasn't the best at drawing, but I realized I could still create the **worlds and visions in my head** through code — and that felt amazing.

It all began by editing **Tumblr** and **DeviantArt** themes with HTML & CSS.  
From the **art community** to the **dev community**... let’s gooo 🚀
